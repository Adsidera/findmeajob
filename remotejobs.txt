No two days are the same, but you'll be working with a diverse, remote team following an agile, sprint based process.	\n\n# Requirements\nWe're not big on fixed requirements but it's quite likely:\n\n* You're heavily product focussed, you love building and shipping things people will actually use and enjoy thinking about the user and their perspective as well as the technical solution\n* You really buy into the importance of getting things into the hands of a user quickly and then iterating\n* You actively think about when to incur technical debt and when to pay it back\n* You like to explore new technologies and have a keen eye for when something new can add real business value \n* You’re in favour of, but pragmatic about, automated testing. You like all production grade code to have good test coverage but understand when it may make sense to test MVP’s with a lower degree of test coverage\n\nWe generally look for “T shaped” engineers, people who are happy to work across the stack but have a particular leaning. We’re looking for a few different “leanings” at the moment so probably one of the following applies to you:\n\n* You’re passionate about building frontends in React, you’ve either worked with or want to work with React Native and if you’re not already a Typescript & GraphQL user, you’re excited for their potential to improve the way we build complex client applications\n* You’re an engineer but secretly love infrastructure and devops. You’re just as happy writing Ansible scripts, tweaking kubernetes or finding crazy new ways for CI to make our lives better\n* You’ve been getting deeper and deeper into Elixir and Phoenix over the last few years and as much as you enjoy Rails, you feel like Elixir just might be the future. You love explaining to people what a GenServer is and why it’s awesome\n* You’ve spent a lot of time working with data scientists recently, helping to embed the models they build in production systems	\n\n#Salary\n$75,000\n<span style="opacity:0;">yagJzhkdapAsCMnUw7CpJAMi</span>\n\n#Location\n- EU Only<br /></div></div><div class="instructions"><p style="text-align:center">See more jobs at <a target="_new" href="/remote-companies/catapult">CAtapult</a></p><div class="markdown"># How do you apply?

GOhiring offers digital infrastructure for companies, HR IT-systems, job portals and agencies to enable more direct and productive ways of collaborating. That way, job postings can be published via an API and managed with transparency via digital processes. Thanks to state-of-the-art tools, we have also digitized our own working environment and set up everything for #remote work from anywhere in the world.\n\n**Your role**\n\n- As part of our development team, you will be responsible for building smart, customer-driven front- and back-end solutions\n- This implies solving exciting engineering challenges, starting with MVP\u2019s and iterating from there\n- You collaborate closely with our experienced team of backend developers, product managers, designers and testers\n- You work on complex frontend projects using the latest technology and JS frameworks (such as react.js, ember.js)\n- Depending on your interests and skills, you will work on different parts of our product ecosystem \n\n**Your profile**\n\n- You get excited about good quality code and engineering quests\n- You have at least five years experience in web development and +3 years in Ruby (fullstack) and Javascript frameworks. More languages as a bonus.\n- You value testing, well-documented code and intelligent software design techniques \n- You already have good knowledge about API Design and performance optimization\n- You are conversant in English\n\n**What to expect**&nbsp;\n\n**Remote culture -**&nbsp;Work wherever you are most productive - at home, while traveling or in our office in Berlin. Benefit from processes and mindsets which are 100% oriented towards working flexible hours in the location of your choice. \n\n**Small, agile team -**&nbsp;We believe that work is simply more fun in small teams. Experienced colleagues, jointly defined company targets, a direct exchange and lots of creative leeway: That is what constitutes our understanding of productivity.\n\n**Complex challenges -**&nbsp;Due to our central role in the market, we are closely interlinked with all the players and are able to reach unparalleled depths when it comes to digitizing business processes. In doing so, we encounter new challenges time and time which are waiting to be solved for the benefit of all market players.\n\n**Sounds like an interesting challenge for you?**\n\nWe believe in culture first, skills second: if you are truly interested in this job, you should apply - even if you do not fulfill 100% of the requirements. Because a cultural fit is more important to us than an extra grain of qualification. \n\nSimply send us your profile in addition to your Github handle.

You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\n\n# Responsibilities\n
You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware.	\n\n# Requirements\nWe believe in hiring people that are a good fit for us culturally.\n\nA good fit is actually more important to us than the skill set since we will teach you everything you need to know about our industry.\n\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\n\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\n\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\n\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\n\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus.	\n\n#Salary\n140,000\n<span style="opacity:0;">yagJzhkdapAsCMnUw7CpJAMi</span>\n\n#Location\n- 🌏Worldwide<br /></div></div><div class="instructions"><p style="text-align:center">See more jobs at <a target="_new" href="/remote-companies/empire-flippers">Empire Flippers</a></p><div class="markdown"># How do you apply?

Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better, he thought, to use our mobile phones to study? When he couldn't find an effective mobile learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and we&rsquo;re determined to support their desire to keep learning as part of their practice.\n\nWe hold tightly to our core values to innovate, captivate, and educate. These ideals are the heartbeat of our company and we are rigorous in finding coworkers who share these qualities.\n\n\nWho We Are Looking For\n\nOver 1 billion practice questions answered. Nearly 500,000 active monthly users. We are growing again and it&rsquo;s time to add to our team. We are looking to work with the best, someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone bright with a proven track record in developing software for high quality, scalable applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our team and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward. As an engineer at HLT you will be responsible for the API that powers all our applications.\n\nWhat you need to be successful at HLT:\n\n\n* Commitment to quality - Quality not quantity you know what it takes to write maintainable, scalable code.

Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better, he thought, to use our mobile phones to study? When he couldn't find an effective mobile learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and we&rsquo;re determined to support their desire to keep learning as part of their practice.\n\nWe hold tightly to our core values to innovate, captivate, and educate. These ideals are the heartbeat of our company and we are rigorous in finding coworkers who share these qualities.\n\n\nWho We Are Looking For\n\nOver 1 billion practice questions answered. Nearly 500,000 active monthly users. We are growing again and it&rsquo;s time to add to our team. We are looking to work with the best, someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone bright with a proven track record in developing software for high quality, scalable applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our team and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward. As an engineer at HLT you will be responsible for the API that powers all our applications.\n\nWhat you need to be successful at HLT:\n\n\n* Commitment to quality - Quality not quantity you know what it takes to write maintainable, scalable code. If you can&rsquo;t prove it you are not done, testing is just part of your process.\n\n* Team player - You have strong opinions on how things should be done and you can express them thoughtfully and respectfully but when the decision is made you move with the team and own it.\n\n* Independent / self motivated- You have a sense of maturity and a strong sense of commitment. You thrive on autonomy and your desire to perform comes from within. You have the ability to work independently as well as collaboratively.\n\n* You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms\n\n* You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement\n\n* You are a seasoned Rubyist and have a solid knowledge of Rails\n\n* You have a firm grasp of PostgreSQL\n\n\n\n\nOther technologies that will be considered a plus:\n\n\n* &nbsp;Heroku\n\n* Modern mobile app architecture&nbsp;\n\n* Modern JS and CSS frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow We Work\n\nWhile our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want.

We have code reviews and like to pair program when it makes sense. We love solid tests and continuous integration, and we deploy several times a week. We’ve worked hard to create our version of an ideal developer environment. \n\nWorking with us, you can expect low overheads, support and camaraderie when you need it + minimal interruptions the rest of the time with no arbitrary deadlines or strict release cycles. \n\nDevelopers at MeetEdgar have a huge impact on the product and a lot of autonomy when it comes to technical decisions and helping our team get it right for our users. You’ll have final responsibility for the solutions you build, from discussing feasibility with the product designer all the way through to deployment, so your teammates know exactly who to shower with praise when you ship to production.\n\nWe also set aside opportunities from time to time for everybody to pursue their own creative ideas from start to finish in company hack weeks and to learn from one another during opt-in activities like lightning lunches and demos of work happening in other departments. \n\nWe have a strong interest in actively improving our work environment, and at MeetEdgar you can expect your voice to be heard.	\n\n# Requirements\nYour experience should include . . . \n\n✅ A history of professional experience as part of a software development team\n\n✅ Senior-level development skills and the ability to handle the full development life cycle from start to finish (for us, senior-level means you have the skillset and previous experience to fairly fearlessly approach even the major-est changes we want to make to the product; a proven history of exercising good judgement in decisions that consider the full scope of the project; and that you deliver code that not only works but is well-tested, well-reasoned, and well-documented as needed)\n\n✅ Modern JS development experience with React and Redux (or similar) \n\n✅ You've solved common problems like authentication, payment, asynchronous processing, and scheduling\n\n✅ You have been celebrated for your communication skills and commitment to working as part of a team trying to build something together! \n\n✅ You've worked to improve the dev process in previous roles and recognize the value of maintaining and contributing to an awesome company culture\n\nSome logistical notes about the job . . . \n\n- This is a full-time position with 40 hour work weeks (we're super committed to adhering to those 40 hours... emergency situations that require additional time or off-hours are very rare here!)\n\n- We're remote, but we work synchronously. We keep to normal, regular business hours in North American time zones.

There is an existing daily meeting at 9:00am America/Los Angeles (-07:00) PDT.\n\n\nREQUIRED SKILLS:\n\n- Excellent written and spoken English\n\n- Ruby on Rails (experience migrating to latest version)\n\n- MongoDB (Mongoid)\n\n- jQuery\n\n- Bootstrap\n\n- SASS (CSS)\n\n\nDESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:\n\n- CoffeeScript\n\n- Vue.js\n\n\nSTART DATE:\n\nAs soon as possible.\n\n\nHOURLY RATE:\n\nThe pay rate for this role is from $40 to $80 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.&nbsp;\n\n\nEXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:\n\n3-4 months\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nClient is also open to someone spending more than 4 hours per day on the project once they are up to speed.\n\n\nIf you're interested, please DO NOT apply via StackOverflow - follow the link below and click the "Login to Apply" button:\n\n\nhttps://www.scalablepath.com/view-position/ef4cf1f3/senior-ruby-on-rails-developer?pt[]=9470<span style="opacity:0;">yagJzhkdapAsCMnUw7CpJAMi</span></div></div><div class="instructions"><p style="text-align:center">See more jobs at <a target="_new" href="/remote-companies/scalable-path">Scalable Path</a></p><div class="markdown"># How do you apply?

We currently have over 290 clients based throughout the UK and Ireland. These clients are a mixture of Theatres, Arts, Festivals and speciality offerings such as Ice Skating and Christmas attractions. We are a consistently profitable company with a healthy year on year growth. The new features and abilities we are adding to Ticketsolve put us in an excellent place to deliver strong growth in the coming years.\n\n# Introduction\nWe are currently going through an exciting evolution of our platform. We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern \"single page application\", exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.\n\nWe have migrated our customer-facing ticket selling application to Ember and our ticket scanning application to Ember, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the immediate focus been on our \"Point of Sale\". We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting\/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.\n\nOver the last few months, we have grown the front end, Ember team. We are now looking to expand our server team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. Ideally, this person will have RoR experience. In terms of experience, we are open to both junior and experienced developers - the main requirement is talent and enthusiasm.\n\n# How we work\nWe run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.\n\nFrom a coding perspective, we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.\n\nIn general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.\n\n# Remote working\nOur development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malm\u00f6, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and main office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.\n\nRemote working has become part of our company DNA. We believe that it offers a lot of advantages to both Ticketsolve and employees. This means that you should be comfortable working as part of a remote team. If this is new to you, don't worry, it was for us at the beginning as well. We now have lots of experience helping people settle in - so keep an open mind and imagine a working day with no daily commute!\n\nImportant to note that timezones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European and Asian time zones are preferable, as it allows for collaboration at reasonable times. \n\n Apply now and work remotely at Ticketsolve",	"baseSalary":{	"@type": "MonetaryAmount",	"currency": "USD",	"value": "80000",	"unitCode": "ANN"	},"employmentType":"FULL_TIME","industry":"Startups","jobLocationType":"TELECOMMUTE","jobLocation":{"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"Anywhere","addressRegion":"Anywhere","streetAddress":"Anywhere","postalCode":"Anywhere","addressLocality":"Anywhere"}},"title":"Ruby on Rails Developer Role","image":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/8a497eea5c6b01bba1bcc5c243fea7061560948750.png","occupationalCategory":"","workHours":"Flexible","validThrough":"2019-09-17T05:52:30-07:00","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ticketsolve","sameAs":null,"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.io\/assets\/jobs\/8a497eea5c6b01bba1bcc5c243fea7061560948750.png"}}</script><a class="preventLink" href="/remote-jobs/73476-remote-ruby-on-rails-developer-role-ticketsolve"><img data-z="134" data-extension="png" itemprop="image" class="logo lazyload lazy" data-src="https://remoteok.io/assets/jobs/8a497eea5c6b01bba1bcc5c243fea7061560948750.png" /></a></td><td class="company position company_and_position"><a itemprop="url" class="preventLink" href="/remote-jobs/73476-remote-ruby-on-rails-developer-role-ticketsolve"><a itemprop="hiringOrganization" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization" class="companyLink" target="_new" href="/remote-companies/ticketsolve"><h3 itemprop="name">Ticketsolve</h3></a><br /><h2 itemprop="title">Ruby on Rails Developer Role</h2></a><span class="original tooltip" title="This position is verified to be remote"><img src="/assets/logo.png?1" width="16" height="16" style="border-radius:100%;vertical-align:middle;margin-left: 4px;margin-top:-2px;"></span> <span class="verified tooltip" title="Verified listing: this company posted from an email and/or domain associated with this company and is trustworthy">verified</span><br /><span style="white-space:nowrap;max-width: 100%;display: block;text-overflow: ellipsis;overflow: hidden;font-size:13px;opacity:0.8">European and Asian time zones are preferable</span></td><td class="company position company_and_position_mobile"><a class="preventLink" target="_new" href="/remote-jobs/73476-remote-ruby-on-rails-developer-role-ticketsolve"><h2>Ruby on Rails Developer Role</h2></a><br /><a class="preventLink" target="_new" href="/remote-companies/ticketsolve"><h3>Ticketsolve</h3></a> <span class="location tooltip" title="European and Asian time zones are preferable">European and Asian time zones are preferable</span><span class="original tooltip" title="Originally posted on Remote OK"><img src="/assets/logo.png" width="16" height="16" style="border-radius:100%;vertical-align:middle;margin-left: 4px;"></span><br /><a class="no-border tooltip" title="Add tag to job filterruby jobs"><div class="tag" itemprop="skills"><h3>ruby</h3></div></a><a class="no-border tooltip" title="Add tag to job filterrails jobs" href="/remote-rails-jobs"><div class="tag" itemprop="skills"><h3>rails</h3></div></a><a class="no-border tooltip" title="Add tag to job filtersoftware developer jobs" href="/remote-dev-jobs"><div class="tag" itemprop="skills"><h3>dev</h3></div></a><a class="no-border tooltip" title="Add tag to job filterdigital nomad jobs" href="/remote-digital-nomad-jobs"><div class="tag" itemprop="skills"><h3>digital nomad</h3></div></a></td><td class="tags"><a class="no-border tooltip-set"><div rel="follow" class="tag tag-ruby"><h3>ruby</h3></div></a><a class="no-border tooltip-set" data-tooltip="Add tag to filters" href="/remote-ruby+rails-jobs"><div rel="follow" class="tag tag-rails"><h3>rails</h3></div></a><a class="no-border tooltip-set" data-tooltip="Add tag to filters" href="/remote-ruby+dev-jobs"><div rel="follow" class="tag tag-dev"><h3>dev</h3></div></a><a class="no-border tooltip-set" data-tooltip="Add tag to filters" href="/remote-ruby+digital-nomad-jobs"><div rel="follow" class="tag tag-digital-nomad"><h3>digital nomad</h3></div></a></td><td class="location tooltip-set" data-tooltip="European and Asian time zones are preferable">European and Asian time zones are preferable</td><td class="time"><a target="_new" href="/remote-jobs/73476-remote-ruby-on-rails-developer-role-ticketsolve">1yr</a></td><td class="source"><a rel="nofollow" class="no-border tooltip" target="_new" href="javascript:alert('This job post is older than 30 days and the position is probably filled.

We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;build a business&nbsp;not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.\n\nSee how our clients&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;our approach&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;recognition we've received&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;holiday gifts&nbsp;each year.

We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!\n\nA Day In The Life\n\nDuring a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;team&nbsp;week&nbsp;recaps&nbsp;and&nbsp;years in review&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!\n\nWhat Does Success Look Like?\n\nDuring your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several \"Headway 101\" sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.\n\nAfter this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;Welcome aboard!\n\nOngoing Support\n\nEach week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful.

Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase.
